# Stacks and Queues

## Overview

In computer science, stacks and queues are two fundamental data structures used for managing collections of elements. A stack is a LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure, which means that the last element added to the stack is the first element to be removed. On the other hand, a queue is a FIFO (First In First Out) data structure, which means that the first element added to the queue is the first element to be removed.

Stacks and queues can be used for a variety of applications, including parsing or tokenizing, expression evaluation, and graph traversal. In this document, we will provide an overview of stacks and queues, including their basic operations, implementation, and common use cases.

## Stacks

### Basic Operations

A stack supports the following basic operations:

* push(item): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
* pop(): Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
* peek(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
* isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating whether the stack is empty.

        
## Common Use Cases

## Stacks are commonly used for the following applications:

    Expression evaluation (e.g., converting infix expressions to postfix expressions)
    Graph traversal (e.g., depth-first search)
    Function call stack management

## Queues
## Basic Operations

## A queue supports the following basic operations:

    *enqueue(item): Adds an element to the back of or from rear of the queue.
    *dequeue(): Removes and returns the element at the front of the queue.
    *peek(): Returns the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
    *isEmpty(): Returns a boolean indicating whether the queue is empty.

## Common Use Cases

## Queues are commonly used for the following applications:

    *Task scheduling
    *Job processing
    *Breadth-first search
    
## Conclusion
Stacks and queues are fundamental data structure used in computer science for managing collections of elements. A stack is a LIFO data structure, while a queue is a FIFO data structure. Both stacks and queues support basic operations such as push/enqueue, pop/dequeue, peek, and isEmpty. Stacks and queues can be implemented using arrays or linked lists, depending on the requirements of the application.
